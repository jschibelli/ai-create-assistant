## Recent Implementation Updates (2025-03-14)

### Key Architecture Decisions
1. **Service-Based Architecture**
   - Created dedicated service modules for AI providers, usage tracking, and subscription management
   - Implemented in `src/services/ai/base.ts`, `src/services/ai/openai.ts`, and `src/services/ai/anthropic.ts`
   - This approach enables easy switching between models and simplified testing

2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Implemented in `src/lib/circuitBreaker.ts` to handle potential API outages
   - Provides graceful degradation when third-party services are unavailable
   - Automatically recovers when services return to normal

3. **Redis-Based Rate Limiting and Usage Tracking**
   - Set up in `src/middleware/rateLimit.ts` and `src/services/usage/tracker.ts`
   - Scales horizontally across multiple application instances
   - Provides real-time usage metrics while minimizing database load

4. **Enhanced Prisma Schema**
   - Extended the data model with feature-based subscription tiers and granular usage tracking
   - Implemented in `src/prisma/schema.prisma`
   - Added schema validation and relationship integrity constraints

### Core Components Implemented
1. **AI Service Integration**
   - Created abstract base class and concrete implementations for OpenAI and Anthropic
   - Standardized interface for generating content regardless of underlying provider
   - Added model-specific metadata (token limits, pricing) for usage management

2. **Usage Tracking System**
   - Implemented real-time token usage tracking with Redis
   - Added asynchronous database updates to persist usage data
   - Created tiered usage limits based on subscription level

3. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Configured NextAuth.js with multiple providers (Email, Google)
   - Added role-based permissions to session tokens
   - Implemented subscription data in user sessions for frontend authorization

4. **Model Selection UI**
   - Created `src/components/AIModelSelector/index.tsx` component
   - Added model-specific metadata to help users choose the appropriate AI
   - Implemented conditional rendering based on subscription tier

5. **Client-Side API Hooks**
   - Developed `src/lib/api/useAI.ts` hook using SWR for optimized data fetching
   - Added error handling and loading states
   - Implemented request cancellation for improved UX

### Next Implementation Priorities
1. **Content Editor Integration**
   - Develop rich text editor with markdown support
   - Implement AI-assisted content generation within the editor
   - Add version history and collaborative editing features

2. **Subscription Management**
   - Create subscription upgrade/downgrade flows
   - Implement usage quota enforcement
   - Add proactive notifications for quota limits

3. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Develop usage visualization components
   - Implement content performance metrics
   - Create cost optimization suggestions
