## Communication Plan
1. **Weekly Check-ins**  
   - Short meetings to address blockers, track progress, and update the backlog.

2. **Sprint Ceremonies**  
   - **Sprint Planning:** Kick off each 2-week milestone.
   - **Retrospectives:** Evaluate successes and pain points at the end of each milestone.

3. **Issue Tracking**  
   - Centralized backlog for features, bugs, and tasks.
   - Clearly mapped epics for each milestone to maintain visibility.

4. **Stakeholder Reviews**  
   - Periodic demos to John (Client) and compliance teams.
   - Sign-off on each milestone deliverable to confirm acceptance.

## Architecture Overview

1. **Data/Control Plane Separation**
   - **Data Plane:** High-volume AI operations, collaborative editing, and content generation.
   - **Control Plane:** Subscription management, analytics, administrative dashboards, and configuration.

2. **Multi-Tenant Context Propagation**
   - **AsyncLocalStorage** (or similar) for consistent tenant/user context across the request lifecycle.
   - **Prisma Middleware** enforcing tenant filters on database queries.
   - AI prompts prefixed with tenant context to prevent cross-tenant data contamination.

3. **AI Governance & Compliance**
   - **Content Filtering**: Checks user prompts and AI responses for prohibited or risky content.
   - **Audit Logging**: Records prompts, model responses, and compliance flags in an immutable datastore.
   - **Fallback Cascade**: Progressive AI degrade paths (lower-tier models, cached responses) to handle partial outages.

4. **Command Pattern & Event Sourcing**
   - **CQRS** for clear separation of write operations (commands) and read operations (queries).
   - **Snapshotting & Partial Event Logs** to manage performance in large documents.
   - **Collaborative Editing** with robust version control and conflict resolution.

5. **Knowledge Integration**
   - **Entity Extraction** to enrich prompts with domain-specific terminology.
   - **Vector/Graph DB** for context retrieval (Neo4j, Pinecone, etc.).
   - **Prompt Augmentation**: AI prompts are automatically enriched with relevant organizational knowledge.

6. **Usage Tracking & Budget Controls**
   - **Token-based Usage**: Real-time counters in Redis for cost and usage.
   - **Budget Enforcement**: Subscription tiers define daily/monthly token limits.
   - **Usage Dashboards**: Track consumption, forecast costs, and alert on threshold breaches.

---

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Model Performance Variability**
  - **Mitigation:** Monitoring & fallback models; circuit breakers for timeouts.
- **Compliance Violations**
  - **Mitigation:** Thorough content filtering, audit logs, and advanced classification for regulated industries.
- **Distributed System Complexity**
  - **Mitigation:** Use incremental POCs for event sourcing, knowledge graph, etc.; maintain strict architectural boundaries.
- **Scalability Constraints**
  - **Mitigation:** Horizontal scaling via microservices, load balancing, and Redis clustering for caching/rate limiting.

---

## Success Criteria & Next Steps

1. **Tenant Isolation**  
   - Automated tests confirm that all data (DB queries, AI prompts) is scoped to the correct tenant.

2. **Governance & Compliance**  
   - Content filtering and audit logs meet baseline requirements for regulated enterprise clients.

3. **Usage & Budget Visibility**  
   - Admin dashboards accurately reflect real-time token usage and costs.

4. **Command/Event Sourcing**  
   - Reduced editor conflicts and robust version history for enterprise documents.

5. **Knowledge Integration**  
   - Demonstrable improvement in AI content relevance, measured by user acceptance rates.

---

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Kickoff Meeting**  
   - Review final architecture with all stakeholders.
   - Schedule sprints and confirm developer QA environment setup.

2. **Weeks 1-2 (Tenant Isolation & Basic Governance)**  
   - Implement request-scoped tenant context.
   - Set up basic content filtering in AI pipeline.
   - Conduct proof-of-concept tests to verify data isolation.

3. **POC Validations**  
   - Each milestone will have a brief POC to test performance, developer ergonomics, and integration feasibility before wide rollout.

By following this updated project plan, we align stakeholders on a cohesive development roadmap that balances **immediate business value** with **long-term architectural sustainability**.
